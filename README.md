# Leaderboard Challenge Application üèÜ

This is a full-stack MERN application that provides a real-time, interactive leaderboard system. Users can be selected from a list, points can be claimed for them, and rankings are updated instantly for all connected clients using WebSockets.

The project was built using React for the frontend, and Node.js with Express for the backend, all connected to a MongoDB Atlas database.


## ‚ú® Features

-   **Real-Time Leaderboard:** Rankings update instantly across all open browsers without needing a page refresh, thanks to Socket.IO.
-   **Dynamic Point System:** A "Claim" button awards a random number of points (1-10) to the selected user.
-   **User Management:** You can add new users to the leaderboard directly from the UI.
-   **Persistent Data:** All users, points, and claim history are stored in a MongoDB database.
-   **Claim History:** A detailed log of every point claim is recorded and displayed.
-   **Advanced UI:** A modern, clean, and responsive user interface featuring a special "Podium" view for the top 3 ranked users.
-   **Efficient Pagination:** The claim history is paginated, ensuring the application remains fast and efficient even with thousands of records.

    *   Navigate to the backend directory:
        ```bash
        cd backend
        ```
    *   Install the dependencies:
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
    *   Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add your MongoDB connection string:
        ```
        # .env file
        PORT=5000
        MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@<cluster-url>/leaderboardDB?retryWrites=true&w=majority
        ```
    *   Start the backend server:
        ```bash
        npm start
        ```
    The backend will be running on `http://localhost:5000`.

3.  **Frontend Setup:**

        ```bash
        cd frontend
        ```
    *   Install the dependencies:
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
    *   Start the frontend development server:
        ```bash
        npm start
        ```
